# The Battle of the Neighborhoods - Week 1

## Introduction :

**Paris** and **New York** are two major economical and multicultural cites. Both cities become a centre of attention for business, job employment, tourism, residential, education, shopping and sports activities.

This work will be focused on creating and visualizing neighborhood's profiles in boroughs of **Paris** and **New York City**. These profiles will be based on the numbers and categories of venues present in each neighborhood in these cities, classifying each neighborhood based on statistical data and automated analysis using classification algorithms (K-means). Hopefully, these city profiles can give valuable insights about the life and economy of each region, making possible better-informed decision making for business and better public policymaking. Naturally, the target audience of this work are urban planners, policymakers, or urban services business looking to expand. 

## Business Problem :

The main business problem attacked in this work is based on how to determine the optimum location for a new business, a restaurant, bar, or office building. This problem can be solved by means of inferred data about already existing business. Naturally certain types of enterprises tend to be built in the same areas, through economic incentive or public regulations. Data about venue category density in a neighborhood can provide valuable information about **probable new markets** or **regions with low offerings in certain types of service**. It is important to also mention that the inexistence of certain types of enterprises can also mean that there is no demand for their services, indicating that just data about venues, without additional socioeconomic information about the regions, is not sufficient data for constructing a complete picture. Nevertheless, it is possible to construct robust profiles about the urban makeup of the cities, sufficient for kickstarting the plans for new business, and this will be our main goal.
